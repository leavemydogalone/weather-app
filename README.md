A weather app that pulls weather data from the openweathermap API. Pulls the data for the 5 day forecase in whichever city is entered into the search box.

Future changes once I am finished with the rest of TOP curriculum:
add functionality to change the background dependant on the type of weather in the object.

make the first row using the current weather API

make it pretty 

use formik for form validation
